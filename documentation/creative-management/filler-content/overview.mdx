Filler Content is a feature that users (Media Owners) can use to manage creative media assets that will be used as default content for a display billboard when there are no campaigns running on that display. Generally, when a display is not running a campaign, Media Owners usually fill the content of a display with information about contacts, special occasions, etc.

This page helps you understand the filler content menu.

<Info>
      Ensure you have added DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory on the Lynx SSP Platform ([See Add New DOOH Inventory ↗](/documentation/inventory/dooh/add/how-to-add)).
</Info>

By default, after adding DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory, you can see the Screen Status in the form **"Not Connected"** ([See Screen Status ↗](/documentation/inventory/dooh/screens/status)) and Connection Type **"-"** ([See Connection Type ↗](/documentation/inventory/dooh/screens/connect-to-screen#connection-type)). This indicates that the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory on the Lynx SSP Platform is not yet connected to the Screen. Therefore, further configuration is required by connecting the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory that has been added with the Player to display creative content and filler campaigns.

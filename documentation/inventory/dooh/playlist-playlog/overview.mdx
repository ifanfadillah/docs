Playlists are a monitoring feature of **DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory** on the **Lynx SSP Platform** that contains creative content in the form of videos or images from various media plan campaigns that you have created. Meanwhile, **Playlog** contains more detailed information about the playlist. You can see when a piece of creative content is played, from the hour, minute, and second it starts until it finally moves on to the next piece of creative content. 

Additionally, **Playlist & Playlog** data can serve as supplementary information to verify whether the rotation of creative content playback from various media plan campaigns is proceeding as intended.

<Info>
  Both **Playlist & Playlog** data can appear if DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory uses a **ScreenApp connection**. If using an **HTML5 & API Integration connection**, **only Playlog** can be monitored from DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory.

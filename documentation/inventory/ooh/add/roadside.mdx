 ![ Roadside ](/images/documentation/inventory/display/ooh/add/roadside/ooh-add-roadside.png)

Based on the form above, the information or data required to add new OOH (Out-of-Home) Inventory is as follows:


<Steps>
      <Step title="Display Name (Required)">
            You can enter the Display Name or unique name of your OOH (Out-of-Home) Inventory.
      </Step>
      <Step title="SKU (Required)">
            There are no set rules regarding SKU numbering. It all depends on your policy for determining the format and numbering of SKUs. SKUs can be used as unique parameters for performing specific searches on inventory.

            <Info>
                  The **Display Name** & **SKU**  ou use cannot be duplicated. When you enter a Display Name & SKU that has been used previously and still exists in the system, the system will issue a warning that cannot be used.
            </Info>
      </Step>

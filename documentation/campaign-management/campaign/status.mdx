title: "Campaign Status"
---

There are three statuses that a campaign can have, including:

## Not Started
This status indicates that the campaign has not yet reached its start date or that there is no Media Plan currently running (launched).

  style={{ width:"15%" }}
/>

---

## Running
The change in campaign status from Not Started to Running is triggered by the existence of a Media Plan in the campaign whose status has changed to Launched. This indicates that the campaign will start soon when the media plan start date arrives.

## Finished
This status indicates that the campaign has been completed and will end according to the campaign end date.

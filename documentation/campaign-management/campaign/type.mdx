title: "Campaign Type"

There are two types of campaigns, including:

## Regular
This type is used if your client only orders a few slots from your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory or billboards, and it doesn't matter if the content they play is alongside advertisements from other clients. This is because it is possible to play content from various campaigns on a single billboard.

## Exclusive
This type is used if your client wants to book all slots on your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory or billboards. The list of billboards that appear and can be booked in this campaign type are only billboards that have 0% occupancy within a certain period of time (no other campaigns will be/are currently running on those billboards).

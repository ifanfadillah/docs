After creating a media plan, you will be directed to the Schedule tab. The schedule displays the period or duration of the media plan. By default, the period or date duration follows the duration of the campaign created previously. Meanwhile, the time settings are in 24-hour format and the day settings show the entire days for the media plan to be displayed later. 

If there are changes to the schedule, you can modify the media plan schedule according to your campaign preferences. This page helps you understand the Schedule tab and make edits to the menu.

### List Schedule
In this section, you can view the schedule of your media plan. By default, there is one schedule that is automatically created when you create a new media plan. This date range refers to the duration of the campaign for which this media plan is intended. This media plan schedule is used as a reference for when creative content (advertisements) will begin to run and for recording the impressions, reach, and frequency obtained from those advertisements. The schedule properties that can be seen in this table are as follows:

- Date Duration
- Time Settings
- Day Settings

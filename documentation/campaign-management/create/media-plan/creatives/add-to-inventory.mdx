title: "Add Creative to Inventory"
---

In a campaign, there will be several ad contents that will be played or placed in one of your inventories. Creative content refers to the ad contents from your clients.

After selecting the inventory for the media plan ([See Select Inventory to Media Plan ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/inventories/select)), the next step is to enter your client's creative content so that the campaign can be displayed on the inventory. This page helps you understand the creatives tab and enter creative content on the inventory that has been selected in the campaign media plan.

## How to Add Creative to Inventory 

When you are choosing creative content for a billboard media plan, there are several types of formats that can be used, some of which are MP4 Video, HTML5 Video, or Vast Tag.

<Accordion
      title="via Library"
>
      The library is a place where images or videos that you have previously uploaded will appear in this section ([See Media Library ↗](/documentation/creative-management/media-library/overview)).

</Accordion>
<Accordion
      title="via Computer"
>
      If the creative content you want is not yet in the list of media in the Media Library, you can upload image or video media in this section.

      All images or videos that you upload via this page will automatically be added to the media library list.
</Accordion>
<Accordion
      title="via URL Link"
>
      If you have creative content in HTML5 format, you can upload the media via this URL Link tab.
    
      All images or videos that you upload via HTML5 will automatically be added to the media library list.
</Accordion>
<Accordion
      title="via Vast Tag"
>
      If you are going to use creative content with Vast Tag, you can upload the media through this Vast Tag tab.

      <Info>
            If you choose Vast Tag media as creative content for an inventory, that inventory can only have 1 creative content. Vast Tag cannot be mixed with other media formats in 1 inventory.
      </Info>
</Accordion>


After adding or entering creative content to each DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) inventory in the media plan, by default each creative content has a **“Draft”** status ([See Creative Status ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/creatives/status)). You can continue by entering the media plan launch ([See Launch Media Plan ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/launch)) or you can customize the schedule for when the creative content you have added will be displayed ([See Custom Creative Schedule ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/creatives/custom-schedule)).

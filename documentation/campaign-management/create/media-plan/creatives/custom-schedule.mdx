title: "Custom Creative Schedule"
---

By default, creative content will start playing in the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory Media Player based on the schedule specified in the Media Plan (Start & End Date).

In addition to referring to the schedule specified in the Media Plan, another schedule setting that can be used for creative content is a custom schedule setting. This setting can be used for each piece of creative content in an inventory, provided that you leave one piece of content without a custom schedule setting (for example, in one inventory, you select two pieces of creative content for that inventory). 

**Example:** You have a Media Plan A with a duration from October 1, 2025 to October 31, 2025, and you select 1 slot in Inventory A.1. for that media plan. For Inventory A.1, you select 2 pieces of creative content to play. From those 2 pieces of creative content, you can set a custom schedule for one of them.

So, the settings used are as follows.

| **Creative Content Inventory A.1** | **Custom** | **Schedule**                                       |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Creative-content-snack-a.mp4       | TRUE       | 01/10/2025 ~ 31/10/2025 \| 18.00 - 20.00 (custom)  |
| Creative-content-snack-b.mp4       | FALSE      | 01/10/2025 ~ 31/10/2025 \| 00.00 - 23.59 (default) |

With this setting, one slot that you reserve for an inventory can use several different schedules. This is done to give Media Owners the flexibility to provide more services to clients who want to work with you (place advertisements). By reserving just one inventory slot, your clients can freely place multiple advertisements with different schedules using just one advertising slot.

<Info>
      If there is only one creative content in an inventory, you cannot use the custom schedule feature.

To activate the **“Set Schedule”** button, you must select more than one creative content in an inventory.

            This will display a custom creative schedule pop-up.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Date">
            This section is a date period column that you will use as a separate schedule for creative content. The date period that can be selected in this column is within the Media Plan schedule date range. You cannot set a custom creative schedule outside of this date range.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select Time">
            This section is a time period column that you will use as a separate schedule for creative content.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click “Save” Button">
            Once you are satisfied with the custom schedule settings for a creative content, you can click the **“Save”** button to continue.
      </Step>
</Steps>

Then it successfully displays creative content that has been customized according to the schedule and continue the journey to launch your media plan ([See Launch Media Plan ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/launch)).

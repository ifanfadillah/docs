title: "Launch Media Plan"

After completing the media plan creation process, starting from scheduling, selecting inventory, adding creative content and generate report, the next step is to launch the media plan.

Launching a Media Plan is an action that indicates that your campaign is ready to begin. Once this process is complete, the Campaign status will change from **"Not Started"** to **"Running"** and the Media Plan status will change from **"Draft"** to **"Launched"**. The system will automatically read the start time of all media plans in a campaign and begin recording impressions, reach, frequency, etc. for that campaign.

<Info>
      Once a Media Plan launched, you will no longer be able to add inventory or change the schedule. The launch process is carried out for each media plan. So, if you have three media plans in a campaign, you must carry out the launch process three times if all media plans are ready for use.

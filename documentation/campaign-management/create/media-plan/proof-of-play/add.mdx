title: "Add Proof of Play"

**Proof of Play (PoP)** is concrete evidence in the form of photos or videos that directly show that a client's creative content or campaign has been successfully displayed on an inventory. This evidence plays a very important role because it bridges the trust between Media Owners and clients. As a Media Owner, you are responsible for documenting each of these displays.

You are not only documenting the displays, but also creating transparency. Clients can see that their ads are actually appearing in the agreed-upon locations. This documentation is then uploaded and becomes an integral part of the campaign report, complementing other data metrics such as impressions. Thus, Proof of Play ensures that clients get a comprehensive and honest picture of how their campaigns are being run.

This page will help you understand Proof of Play (PoP) and add it to your media plan.

You can delete inventory that has been selected or added to a previous media plan, provided that the media plan has not been launched or its status is still **"Draft"**, by following these steps:

<Steps>
      <Step title="Click the “Remove” Button">
            ![Remove Inventory 1](/images/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/inventories/remove/remove-inventories-1.png)     
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click the “Yes, Delete” Button">
            ![Remove Inventory 2](/images/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/inventories/remove/remove-inventories-2.png)       
            
            You will then receive a notification that the inventory has been successfully deleted.

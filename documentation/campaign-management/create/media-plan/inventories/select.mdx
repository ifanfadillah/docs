To run a campaign, you will, of course, have several **inventories** or **billboards** that will be used as the media to display or run the advertisements for that campaign. To select or add this inventory, you can do so in the **Inventories** menu.

This page will help you understand the **Inventories Tab** and how to add or select the inventory that a campaign's media plan will use to run the creative advertisements.

After completing the campaign information ([See Campaign Information ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/campaign-information)), you will be directed to the Media Plan Page to continue configuring the details of your campaign creation.

A **Media Plan** is a setting within a campaign that allows users to divide a slightly more complex brief from a client.

**For example**, if Brand A client wants to place advertisements on billboards that you own in Cities A, B, and C with various types of billboards. Instead of creating 4 different campaigns for the brief, you can create a campaign management structure with only 1 campaign, as shown in the example below.

![Media Plan Example](/images/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/create/media-plan-ex.png)

With the campaign management structure above, you only need to create one campaign. And of course, campaign results reports can be accessed based on the Media Plan and Inventory or Billboard that has been created and selected.

      </Step>
</Steps>

After successfully creating a media plan, its default status is **"Draft”**. You can continue configuring the media plan by changing the schedule if there are any changes ([See Edit a Schedule ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/schedules/edit)). If there are no changes to the media plan schedules, you can immediately select the Inventory that will display your campaign ([See Select Inventory ↗](/documentation/campaign-management/create/media-plan/inventories/select)).

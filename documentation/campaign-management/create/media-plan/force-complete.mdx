This is another action from the dropdown action button that can be taken to forcibly terminate a media plan (media plan already has **"launched"** status) if there is a problem in the field related to one of the inventories or other reasons that require you to terminate the media plan. 

When the **“Force Complete”** action is taken, the media plan status will change from **"Launched"** to **“Finished”**.

<Info>
      If you want to continue with a media plan that has been forced to end, you cannot reuse that media plan. Instead, you must create a new media plan.

      If the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory selected in the media plan is **not connected to ScreenApp**, you do not need to continue this process.

Playlist order is a feature that displays the order of content that appears in each inventory. You can change the order or sort the content playlist of a campaign or filler content. To do this, you need to make sure beforehand that:

1. Ensure that the media player from your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory has the ScreenApp application installed on it ([See Screen App Installation ↗]()).
2. Ensure that the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory you will use in a campaign is connected to the Screen App ([See Screen App Connection ↗]()).
3. DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory already contains creative content from the media plan campaign that is running or has been sent to the playlist ([See Sent Creative to Playlist ↗]()).

This page helps you organize the order of creative content on the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory playlist connected to ScreenApp.

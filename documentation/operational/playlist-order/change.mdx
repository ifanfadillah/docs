If there are changes to the creative sequence displayed on DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory, you can change or edit it through the following steps:

<Steps>
      <Step title="Click 'Sort Playlist' Button">
            ![Change Playlist Order 1](/images/documentation/operational/playlist-order/change/change-the-playlist-order-1.png)

            This will display the Creative List in the selected DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory.

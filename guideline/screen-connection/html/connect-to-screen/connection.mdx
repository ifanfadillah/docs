## HTML5 Version
Lynx HTML5 has several versions that can be selected based on the CMS (Content Management System) connection you use for DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory. The differences between each version are as follows:

### Standart Version
The HTML5 Standard version is an HTML connection that can be used on general players with auto-refresh and a stable internet connection. If there are disruptions or the internet connection is unstable, the connection to DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory will be hampered.

### Light Version
HTML5 Light version is an HTML connection that can be used on general players with auto-refresh and can be used on minimal internet networks. Unlike the Standard Version, if there are disruptions or unstable or minimal internet connection, the connection to DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory will continue to run.

### Auto Loop
HTML5 Auto loop is an HTML connection that can be used on general players or Smart TVs without auto-refresh, and later HTML5 will run with auto-refresh.

This feature allows you, as a Media Owner, to create private auctions that can only be accessed by a select group of advertisers. Unlike open auctions, Private Marketplace (PMP) Deals give you complete control to sell premium inventory at a predetermined floor price.

        <Accordion title="Fixed Price">
            Fixed Price is the price you set where the auction will be won by the bidder who offers the price you set.

            **Example :** You set the price at $5.
           
            If there are 3 advertisers with the following bid values:
            - Advertiser A → $3
            - Advertiser B → $5
            - Advertiser C → $7
            
            **So the winner is Advertiser B, who pays $5.**
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="1st Price">
            In this model, the auction winner will pay the exact price they bid. The winner is the bidder with the highest price.

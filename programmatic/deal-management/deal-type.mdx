title: "Deal Type"
---

The **Deal Type** is a property that indicates the type of deal you are creating. There are two types of deals you can create: **Programmatic Guaranteed (PG)** and **Private Marketplace (PMP)**.

## Programmatic Guaranteed (PG)

Programmatic Guaranteed (PG), also known as Automated Guaranteed or Programmatic Direct, is a purchasing method that automates the negotiation and contract process normally carried out in Direct (Regular) Campaigns. It is a one-to-one agreement between the advertiser and you as the Media Owner (Publisher).

## Private Marketplace (PMP)

Private Marketplace (PMP) is a private or closed auction that can only be accessed by a select group of advertisers invited by you as the Media Owner (publisher). PMP is between Open Auction (open auction for all) and Programmatic Guaranteed (direct guaranteed agreement).

There are two types of deal statuses, as follows:

### Inactive
Inactive is the default status after a deal is created. While the status is still inactive, Advertisers through DSP (Demand-Side Platform) cannot use the deal and you must activate it or change its status to **Active**.

### Active
Active is a status where the deal you created can be used for Programmatic Campaign transactions by Advertisers on DSP (Demand-Side Platform). You can activate the deal at any time and ensure that the “Active” deal is still within the specified period.

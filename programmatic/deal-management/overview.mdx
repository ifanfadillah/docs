Deal management is a feature that helps you, as a Media Owner, publish or sell your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory into Programmatic Campaigns. Unlike open auctions and Direct (Regular) Campaigns, this feature allows you to create various types of closed deals, such as **Programmatic Guaranteed (PG)** or **Private Marketplace (PMP)**, which can only be accessed by specific advertisers or agencies.

This page will help you create and manage all deals efficiently. As such, this feature is at the core of programmatic campaigns on the Lynx SSP platform, where you can offer your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) inventory to specific advertisers at pre-agreed prices and terms, thereby maximizing the value of each asset you own.

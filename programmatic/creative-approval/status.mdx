There are three types of status in creative approval, as follows:

## Need Approval
Need Approval is the default status when an advertiser submits creative content on the DSP (Demand-Side Platform) for your review. You must review and decide whether to approve or reject the creative content for display and run a programmatic campaign on your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) inventory.

## Rejected
Rejected is a status where you have reviewed and rejected creative content from the Advertiser, so you cannot run a programmatic campaign on your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory and must resubmit creative content according to the criteria.

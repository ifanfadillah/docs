The Creative Approval feature allows you, as a media owner, to review and approve programmatic ad content before it airs on your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory. The Creative Approval feature helps you perform manual checks to ensure that every piece of creative content from advertisers on the DSP (Demand-Side Platform) complies with your policies and standards. This allows you to maintain the quality and integrity of your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) inventory, while also assuring advertisers that their ads will be displayed in an appropriate environment.

This page helps you understand the Creative Approval feature.

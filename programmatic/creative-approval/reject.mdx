## How to Reject Creative

You can reject creatives from advertisers to prevent them from running programmatic campaigns on your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) inventory because they do not meet the criteria by following these steps: 

<Steps>
      <Step title="Click 'View Detail' Button">
      ![Approve Creative](/images/programmatic/creative-approval/Reject%20Creative%20-%201.png)
            
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review Detail Creative">
      ![Approve Creative](/images/programmatic/creative-approval/Reject%20Creative%20-%202.png)

      <Info>
            Make sure you have reviewed all the information from the creative before making a decision to Approve or Reject, because once approved, you cannot change the status back!
      </Info>
            
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click the 'Reject' button">
      ![Approve Creative](/images/programmatic/creative-approval/Reject%20Creative%20-%203.png)
            
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enter Reason for Rejecting Creative">
      ![Approve Creative](/images/programmatic/creative-approval/Reject%20Creative%20-%204.png)
            
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click the 'Reject' button">
      ![Approve Creative](/images/programmatic/creative-approval/Reject%20Creative%20-%205.png)
            
      </Step>
</Steps>

So Creative was successfully rejected and its status became **Rejected**.

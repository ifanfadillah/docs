Ad Exchange is a page for monitoring the performance of programmatic campaigns currently running on your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory as a Media Owner. Through Ad Exchange, you can see how the activity log from the Ad Server runs between Lynx SSP as a Supply-Side Platform and the connected DSP (Demand-Side Platform).
